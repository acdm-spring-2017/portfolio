      <h2>What is something that is lost in the process of making changes, and why might this ultimately matter?</h2>

      <p>In my first synthesis, I had to heavily manipulate the raw data I collected from this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ko3un3a7nzbb46l/AAABnFV4AgfYtDn3RvmXRiDta?dl=0">dataset</a>. I was faced with a series of choices when deciding how to handle the presentation of this data. The inital set I obtained from my heart rate trackers was lengthy, timestamped, and entirely too many data points to make a readable visualization. I tried several variations of averaging and cutting this data with python to output a set that was able to be displayed in a clear, consise way. Interestingly enough, the reason I chose to initally engage with this topic is because I found myself frustrated with the smoothing technique that fitbit uses to display data. I wanted my whole data, not five minute averages. When I reached this problem in my visualization's creation, I understood a bit more why they display it as they do. I, however, opted to smooth my data differently. I used python to separate it into similar five minute buckets, but instead of averaging the values over five minutes, I took the highest value reached for each bucket. Is this innaccurate in a different way? Absolutely. It's not truthful to assume the highest heartrate in a given time period is the most representative but it allowed me to view something that fitbit's visualizations cannot display: rapid changes. When data is averaged, it loses the ability to display any peaks of high or low. If my heart rate climbed suddenly to 180, but only stayed there for a minute, it would never show on fitbit's visualizations. The way I dealt with my data allowed these peaks to be much clearer. This is what I personally was looking for at the time, so I was ultimately satisfied, but it stands as a great example of the drastic impact processing data in different ways can alter the meaning.</p>

      <h2>If you could convert this visualization to something else (bar graph vs. scatter plot, etc.), what would you choose? How would might user experience change if you made this change?</h2>

      <p>For my bar graph in <a href="https://mayaelaine.github.io/synthesis-2/Maya%20Puskaric/">synthesis two</a>, I had quite a bit of trouble initially deciding the best graph type to display the data. Now, looking back, I think I would most likely be interested in working the data into a <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart">Line Chart</a> with the toggle buttons being the different hospital names rather than years. In this way, the data would focus on one single hospital at a time but it would show a much clearer timeline of how it's graded have dropped or raised over the past years. This type of display would be better for observing individual hospital scores, while my original bar type was better for comparing the hospitals with each other. Since I was most interested in looking at the data investigatively, the bar fit best with my goals at the time. There are many different ways to display almost all sets of data and this project revealed to me how the purpose and aim of the author can end up altering the final outcome of the design and type of visualization.</p>

      <h2>How you would change these design elements under different circumstances? How would you revise for an expert on your topic, or for someone who knew nothing about your topic?</h2>

      <p>In <a href="https://mayaelaine.github.io/synthesis-1/Maya%20Puskaric/">synthesis one</a>, I got my first taste of applying design elements to further the effectiveness of a data visualization. Was it a resounding success? Not really. But, I was ultimately happy enough with how it turned out, and it provided an excellent chance to practice applying design attributes I have worked with for years, such as font, palettes, and spacing, to an interactive and code based project rather than the still, 2D work I am so familiar with. Working through this project (and others) helped me gain confidence not just with data visualization design, but with web based design overall. If I were to alter this design for different audiences, I imagine I would proceed this way:</p>

      <div class="half">
        <p><b>For an expert:</b> I would tone down the color palette greatly. I tend to make things highly decorative by nature but if I was making this for a doctor or someone of that nature, I would attempt to stick to a more minimal and professional theme. A white or light plain background with a dark serif font would be a good starting place. It would be an interesting challenge to find colors that still worked harmoniously when overlapped, yet easily identifiable as different values, when working with a more basic scheme.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half">
        <p><b>For someone new:</b> In a way I did make this for someone new. However, most directly I made it for myself. If I were to alter this to be handed out to any average person, I would likely keep the colors similar. I would focus more on increasing readability by playing with whitespace and padding, and I would try and integrate the explanation page as the first element the user sees rather than an afterthought. I would use the dataset as more of a support to the quest for information I describe rather than the information as support to the dataset.</p>

      <h2>Why did you choose this particular comparison? Would the comparison be more effective with additional revisions? If so, what revisions?</h2>

      <p>When I was put to the task of effectively comparing the <a href="http://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/">hospital grades</a> for <a href="https://mayaelaine.github.io/synthesis-2/Maya%20Puskaric/">synthesis two</a>, I was puzzled with how to deal with the several comparisons happening at the same time. While the hospitals were being compared against each other, they were also being compared agaist themselves. To relay this, I chose to use a bar graph with multiple bars per label point. This way, as the years were toggled, the user could choose to display only one year at a time to compare hospitals or display all years to see a specific hospital's change. I'm not sure the timeline effect of this worked very well in the horozontal format. I would like to try it vertically or changed some other drastic way. There is a unique challenge to consider when it comes to comparing not only one variable at a time, but multiple. Often, simplification is the answer. But when it isn't, it can be tricky to be both readable and effective.</p>

        <h2>How did you finally overcome this obstacle, or when did you know it was time to move on? What did you learn, procedurally, from this obstacle?</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/Team1_Repo/">group project</a> presented an entirely different set of challenges than the individual ones. A lot of the frustrations I faced during this project were from the horrible timing of how it fell during the busiest weekend of the year for me. The first week of the project, I was scrambling in preparation for an event where I am on staff as a photographer. Between the scramble to get as much work done as possible, and leaving the thursday day when we had the class off but still were supposed to meet, I'm sure my group thought I was going to be a useless member. Besides the inital project idea concept stage, I had been entirely abscent until the day before the deadline. That day was rough, the weekend had been long, and I was horribly tired. Running off the last emotional high from the <a href="http://www.mayaelaine.com/tekko-collage">enjoyable event photo experience</a> I had just had, I met the group in the library and we set to it.</p>

        <p>We faced many obstacles throughout that long, long night but also bonded and shared great ideas. At the end of the infinite span of time spent in Hillman, the site still did not have the bokeh chart integrated in a functional way. Realizing time was running out, I went back to square one and developed an alternate way to display the data using google maps that we could integrate into the site if we needed to, just so <i>something</i> was there. We decided we would link to the bokeh chart in the navigation if that was how it came to be. Luckily, my other team members were problem solving to the last minute just all the same, and we were able to get the bokeh plot integrated. Still, my google maps addition was able to be utilized in a different way by displaying each member's single route on their <a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/Team1_Repo/statement_maya.html">own pages</a>.

      <h2>Why does this example stick out in your mind? How might you adapt what you like about it for future work?</h2>

      <p>Really, I could have answered the frustration question and this one as one. The <a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/Team1_Repo/">group project</a> was also the work I was most proud of in the end. Maybe it is driven by how Hillman's harsh lighting saps your mind after too many hours, but I have a fondness for the project despite it being painful to be awake during the entire time spent working on it. Of all the projects, this one looks the most professional in my opinion and also most closely mimicked how a professional team would work. When something was off, there was always someone to suggest an alternative. We encouraged each other and had a fantastic chemistry. We even left with a few new projects in mind that others had suggested as we each talked about our own interests. I feel like this was partly a lucky chance, groups can be highly hit or miss. This grouping just happened to be a very strong one. The final aesthetic of the site is something I am very proud of. I love the integration of the individual routes that I mentioned above. I feel like it really fills an element that was missing in the site's overall presentation. Anyway, thanks guys, it was fun and we did a great job.</p>
