      <h2>What is something that is lost in the process of making changes, and why might this ultimately matter?</h2>

      <p>In my first synthesis, I had to heavily manipulate the raw data I collected from this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ko3un3a7nzbb46l/AAABnFV4AgfYtDn3RvmXRiDta?dl=0">dataset</a>. I was faced with a series of choices when deciding how to handle the presentation of this data. The inital set I obtained from my heart rate trackers was lengthy, timestamped, and entirely too many data points to make a readable visualization. I tried several variations of averaging and cutting this data with python to output a set that was able to be displayed in a clear, consise way. Interestingly enough, the reason I chose to initally engage with this topic is because I found myself frustrated with the smoothing technique that fitbit uses to display data. I wanted my whole data, not five minute averages. When I reached this problem in my visualization's creation, I understood a bit more why they display it as they do. I, however, opted to smooth my data differently. I used python to separate it into similar five minute buckets, but instead of averaging the values over five minutes, I took the highest value reached for each bucket. Is this innaccurate in a different way? Absolutely. It's not truthful to assume the highest heartrate in a given time period is the most representative but it allowed me to view something that fitbit's visualizations cannot display: rapid changes. When data is averaged, it loses the ability to display any peaks of high or low. If my heart rate climbed suddenly to 180, but only stayed there for a minute, it would never show on fitbit's visualizations. The way I dealt with my data allowed these peaks to be much clearer. This is what I personally was looking for at the time, so I was ultimately satisfied, but it stands as a great example of the drastic impact processing data in different ways can alter the meaning.</p>

      <h2>If you could convert this visualization to something else (bar graph vs. scatter plot, etc.), what would you choose? How would might user experience change if you made this change?</h2>

      <p>For my bar graph in <a href="https://mayaelaine.github.io/synthesis-2/Maya%20Puskaric/">synthesis two</a>, I had quite a bit of trouble initially deciding the best graph type to display the data. Now, looking back, I think I would most likely be interested in working the data into a <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart">Line Chart</a> with the toggle buttons being the different hospital names rather than years. In this way, the data would focus on one single hospital at a time but it would show a much clearer timeline of how it's graded have dropped or raised over the past years. This type of display would be better for observing individual hospital scores, while my original bar type was better for comparing the hospitals with each other. Since I was most interested in looking at the data investigatively, the bar fit best with my goals at the time. There are many different ways to display almost all sets of data and this project revealed to me how the purpose and aim of the author can end up altering the final outcome of the design and type of visualization.</p>

      <h2>How you would change these design elements under different circumstances? How would you revise for an expert on your topic, or for someone who knew nothing about your topic?</h2>

      <p>In <a href="https://mayaelaine.github.io/synthesis-1/Maya%20Puskaric/">synthesis one</a>, I got my first taste of applying design elements to further the effectiveness of a data visualization. Was it a resounding success? Not really. But, I was ultimately happy enough with how it turned out, and it provided an excellent chance to practice applying design attributes I have worked with for years, such as font, palettes, and spacing, to an interactive and code based project rather than the still, 2D work I am so familiar with. Working through this project (and others) helped me gain confidence not just with data visualization design, but with web based design overall. If I were to alter this design for different audiences, I imagine I would proceed this way:</p>

      <div class="half">
        <p><b>For an expert:</b> I would tone down the color palette greatly. I tend to make things highly decorative by nature but if I was making this for a doctor or someone of that nature, I would attempt to stick to a more minimal and professional theme. A white or light plain background with a dark serif font would be a good starting place. It would be an interesting challenge to find colors that still worked harmoniously when overlapped, yet easily identifiable as different values, when working with a more basic scheme.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half">
        <p><b>For someone new:</b> In a way I did make this for someone new. However, most directly I made it for myself. If I were to alter this to be handed out to any average person, I would likely keep the colors similar. I would focus more on increasing readability by playing with whitespace and padding, and I would try and integrate the explanation page as the first element the user sees rather than an afterthought. I would use the dataset as more of a support to the quest for information I describe rather than the information as support to the dataset.</p>
