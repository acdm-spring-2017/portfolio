  <h3> <font color=#FF7F50> The goal of this project is to reflect on all the work that has been done this semester and look back at what I can improve on 
    and what I did well. Below you'll see several different components from any of the projects that I have worked on this semster and an answer to
    a different well directed reflection question. Click on each subject link and it will take you to the example of each component. The answer to each 
    reflection question is either listed below or in the link to the subject. Hope you enjoy! </font></h3>

  <h2>Topics of Discussion</h2>
    <ol>  
      <h2><li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081227100740/http://trinity.aas.duke.edu/~jvigdor/segregation/1990trct.txt" target="blank">A dataset I manipulated using Python</a></li></h2>
      <h3>Above is the link to the dataset that I manipulated for both my Synthesis 1 and 2 assignment. The question that I want to answer here is how did my manipulation of the data
      affect the way in which the audience viewed the data. My method of visualizing this data was to create a graph of the United States to visual the population density fo black and brown people in each state.
      I also created a seperate graph of the population density of white people in the US as well to compare it to that of the black and brown population. The goal of this was to visualize the segregation of black 
      and brown people within the US. The manipulation of the data gave the audience a visual that was direct and vivid. When many people look at numbers they are just that numbers and as a result they don't 
      really think about them unless they unerstand what those numbers mean. However when you take the data and create a plot of white and black/brown people someone is easily able to see the segration for themselves.
      It also becomes more realavant to them as well. Everyone who is from somewhere in the US can see their state and ask themselves do I really see this data reflected in my city or state and why.
      An audience now doesn't just see the information and think "oh those numbers seem pretty good or bad", but they can clearly see the difference  between the population within their state. It causes them
      to think deeper about why this segregation exists and are they aware or concious that this is occuring.</h3>

      <h2><li><a href="graphs.html" target="blank">An example of how I made a choice related to visualization type</a></li></h2>
      <h3> An example of a choice I made for visualization was using a bokeh plot to visualize the segregation of the US in the 1990s. This was
       a rather interesting choice of visualization as it was the first time I had heard of this system. Thankfully there was some code availible that allowed
       me to make a plot of all the lower 48 states which is where the data I had was from. The plot also fit perfectly with the data set that I was working with which
       was mentioned above. Then it was simply a matter of laying the two data sets over one another. If I could convert this visualization to something else,
       I would make it a bar graph with the percentages out of 100. The y-axis would be the percentage of black and brown people and the x-axis would be any major city. 
       The way I would make this visualization more effective would be to make it interactive where a person could search their zipcode or city and the graph would then move
       to that section of the visualization. If the visualization were to be more interactive, it might also make the experience more intimate for the individual because thenthey will truly be able to take a personal conncetion to the data.

      <h2><li><a href="graphs.html" target="blank">An example of how I made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other design elements</a></li></h2>
      <h3>In the link above, you will see two plots of the same data. The only diffence is the size of the dots which is the element that I changed.
      In my snythesis 1 assignment, I use a bokeh plot to plot the denisty of black/brown populations in different parts of the United States. 
      When I created the plot the size of the dots was about 5. In my mind I thought that this was reasonable size not too large but not to small either and
      it gave you a sense of where the concentrations were the largest. The problem I ran into with this and my proffessor Matt Lavin pointed this out as well was
      that because the dots were so large they were "blobbing up" for lack of a better term. Because of that it was not as easy to see the where in each state the
      density was greatest. Therefore I chose to decrease the size of the dots to .5. Once the change was applied the map had a completely different view. It was now 
      easier for the user to look at their specific state and identify where the population of black/brown people was greatest. If you knew where the major cities
      within your state were it was easy to see the concentration of the population in that city as well. The change affected my intended audiences perception by giving 
      them a more in depth view of the reaal issue which is that segregation is still an issue in the US. There are states that are completely vacant of any person of color
      and by decreasing the size of the dots it is easier for the user to see that.</h3>

      <h2><li><a href="comparison_graphs.html" target="blank">An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another</a></li></h2>
      <h3>In the example above I chose to compare the population density of white americans to that of balck and brown americans across the country.
      I chose to make this comparison for a few reasons. The issue of race, segregation, and social justice has always been an issue that I am passionate about. 
      Whenever asked about these topics, I always try to find a way not make people fell bad or demonized about their lack of knowledge but to educate them. The goal of this comparison 
      was to educate people. It was to make them re-examine the way in which they think about where they live and/or are from and think about what does race look like where they are from. 
      Where is the racial divide and why? Why are the population of black and brown people in the US so heavily concentrated on major cities and other areas? I chose this topic because it is
      thought provoking, becuase it made us examine who we are and how do we view race. When you look at the two graphs you see the difference in the location of the population
      densities but you don't see much overlap and that makes you think what does that seperation and segregation mean and why are we so segregated.</h3>

      <h2><li><a href="https://jrmercer.github.io/Jahari-Mercer-Synthesis2/">An example of something that frustrated me or took longer than I would have liked</a></li></h2>
      <h3>The thing that frustrated me the most this semester was trying to figure out how to host a bokeh plot on a static html page. What is creazy is that for the team project, I was able to take
      enough time to experiment with differen lines of code and figure out how to create an amazing visualization. At this time however I was stuck working on my visualization of synthesis 2. I was stuck trying to 
      find a way to visualize the difference between the two data sets by possibly using a button or by allowing the user to switch from plot to plot. I had spent penty of time 
      googling different ways to accomplish this task. I tried different bits and pieces of code as well and none would hold up. I knew it was time to give up when I begin to get frustraed and it was time to 
      start thinking of a new alternative. I peronally was not proud at all of the alternative because it wasn't as attractive or cool looking as it could have been. I learned alot from this experience however.
      The main thing I learned, and this pertains to the class as a whole as well, was to make more time for projects and to manage the time that I put into these assignents better. The beauty of the activity log we 
      did for our first project was that it made you do something everyday so that you had something to log onto the chart. Doing something like that for yourself personally is key to doing big projects like this so 
      that you can maximize the project and feel fully comfortable with the quality of your work.</h3>

      <h2><li><a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/Team1_Repo/">An example of something I am particularly proud of</a></li></h2> 
      <h3>This example sticks out in my mind for so many reasons. One the amount of work, time, and energy myself and my team put into this project is phenominal and I think can not be 
      matched at all. I was also really happy that I figured out how to get the buttons to work in order for our group to be able to display each of our travels individually on the 
      graph and make it more interactive and personal to the user. I was also proud at how visually appealing the website looked. It stands out to me because it really shows the improtance of this class.
      Everyone of us had a different skill set and level of experstise that we were able to bring to the table and when we combined those different skill sets, we were able to present a phenominal project. 
      I think this project stands out to me alot as well because there was so much data that had to be interpreted, organized, imported, and displayed and just to be able to do all of that smoothly and efficiently was just amazing.
      It was really great to work with the people on my team as well because they all took such pride in their work and I think that's why I am most proud of this assignment.
