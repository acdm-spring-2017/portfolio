    <h2>Dataset Manipulation</h2>
    <p>For my first synthesis, I scraped two APIs, Spotify and Genius to create a list of an artist or artist’s albums, songs, and the lyrics of those songs. I used Spotify’s API to get the songs, and I used the Genius API to get the song lyrics. Using the Valence measure that Spotify attaches to songs and the lyrics, I was able to calculate sentiment of each song (and the average sentiment of whole albums) by using a function that took the valence value (a value of song happiness of 0.0 to 1.0) and added it to a percent sad value (generated by comparing the percentage of “sad” words in a song to a lexicon of sad words) and the lyrical density to develop a combined idea of the songs musical and lyrical sadness (as I interpreted the valence measure to be measure of overall musical sadness). This ambiguity of measurement is one of the things that gets lost after manipulation, as it is hard to tell right away what are the factors that went into determining a songs sentiment. Also in the process of creating a number, the lyrics themselves become obfuscated from user judgment (which may be more effective than any little algorithm over small data sets). The way the data was manipulated could have a clear influence on how people interpret a song, especially its lyrics, which may sometimes be ambiguous. Essentially, assigning a value to a song may prime someone to interpret things in a different way. Also, in general these two datasets together were perfect for my use cases, although I would have liked it if I could have used only one API to get both lyrics and the valence. Also one of my goals was to make a plot of this sentiment and analyze it over multiple popular artists, although there aren’t a lot of readily available data sets for thing purpose (without using beautiful soup to scrape a Wikipedia table).</p>

    <section id="viz">
    <h2>Vizualization</h2>
    <p>For my second synthesis, I visualized the similarity and connections between songs by creating simple networks, where a central node represented a song queried on and other songs were songs directly related (D1 songs), and then songs directly related to the D1 songs (D2 songs). I think a network of some kind would have been useful, although I do think that the explanation behind what the connection were would be useful if displayed or clear in the visualization. Therefore, If I could have chosen anything else to visualize this relationship, I probably would have chosen an arc diagram (list arc diagram here). Although I would lose a visualization of the different levels of connection between driect songs and other songs as the network branches out, I would be able to visualize multiple songs and not just conenctions to the one queried song. Also, it would allow me to visualize another level to the relationship, and I could so something like group on genre and compare songs that connect arross genres.</p>

    <section id="design">
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>For the Team project, I was tasked with coming up with the general design and layout of the site and its different pages. Since the project needed to have multiple different individual elements (each members synthesis) but was centered around one central visualization (the map with all of our location data), There needed to be a central page that would act as a homage and a separate part of the website dedicated to navigating each person’s synthesis. The homepage had the visualization front and center and had each person’s synthesis and a little blurb from it below. Once one of these synthesis links was followed it brought you to a blog like portal in which you could navigate through each person’s synthesis and see their individual location data plotted on a map. This does present a situation where a person who is not very familiar with what we are doing may have trouble reading what we are all about. If I had to do it again I would have added a little introduction to the homepage or I would have given better context to the plots.</p>

    <section id="comp">
    <h2>Comparison</h2>
    <p>When comparing the song sentiments across the 6 studio albums in A Tribe Called Quests discography, I decided to compare overall album sentiment by first averaging each song in the albums sentiment together and then displaying the albums chronologically with a line graph that had both the average sentiments and the songs as points (with sentiment score on the y axis and time as the x axis). I chose this comparison to show the general flow of the Artist’s sentiments over time to give context to A Tribe Called Quest’s journey and to see how their music was possible correlated to current events or events that impacted the group (like a death of one of its members). In addition to this, I also wanted to have a comparison of the overall song distribution of each of the albums, which is why I displayed each song as a point. TO revise this I would need a tool tip or something to give viewers a better idea of what they are looking at, as multiple people have suggested that it’s not clear that each point is a song or they would like to be able to inspect the points to see which individuals songs plotted where. </p>

    <section id="Frustrations">
    <h2>Frustrations</h2>
    <p>Over this semester I had a lot of frustrations with my work, which compounded to create a situation where I was not content with either of the projects as a whole because of theses flaws. One thing that frustrated me was having to traverse other people’s code. For the second synthesis, I used someone’s library to in R to create the song networks. This library was an R wrapper for D3.js, which is a JavaScript plotting library. It became incredibly difficult to navigate this library and try to create the networks as documentation was limited and the fact that it spat out a bunch of unintelligible JavaScript made it difficult to see where errors were. Also, many of the extra features I would have liked to add to my Network did not end up working. Although I did get the bare minimum working, overall I would have liked to have used some other tool or would have liked more time to directly learn D3.js. Over this semester I tried to make myself learn R and do the two projects in it. In hindsight, it might have been better to use the best language for the job instead of forcing it. Also, I think I need to not fear writing my own code instead of using some person’s library. </p>

    <section id="Pride">
    <h2>Pride</h2>
    <p>While there were also problems with my first Synthesis, I really liked the overall concept and visualization. I was happy with how the sentiment worked out. The experiment seemed to work, as the album happiness level did seem to correlate with events the happened to the rap group. Also, it was pleased with how the sentiment calculation worked out to something that seemed to make sense. Overall, I was also pleased with how the overall concept took shape about trying to connect Artists with the people and places they seem to represent to see if they can be canaries in the coal mine for different community’s thoughts. In the future, I would like to apply this same analysis to other artists and see what populations they reached. </p>
