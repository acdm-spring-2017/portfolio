  <p><a href="https://skomaravolu.github.io/synthesis1revision/" target="_blank"> Revision of Synthesis One:</a></p>
   <p><a href="https://skomaravolu.github.io/synthesis1" target="_blank">Original Synthesis One </a></p> 
  <p>Reason for Revisions: For Synthesis One I did not understand how to create the graphs and make the comparison I initially wanted to make, so the second time around for the revision, I was able to make these changes to the website to make it look better as a whole and create graphs using plot.ly. This revision brings the website together with all working links than before. </p>
  
  
  
  <h2 style="font-family:Verdana;color:black;font-size:15px"><center>Discussion of Examples</center></h2>
  <p> 1. A data set that you manipulated or queried: </p>
  <p>For this site I used a data set from the Endangered Species Red List and took out pieces out of information from the data table presented on the site. The link above is the data that was presented to me from the Red List, but I manipulated it to show just the endangered and extinct species. The reason behind this was to show the heavy shift from over the years in terms of endangerment. Instead of using python to organize it, I pulled out the data manually because I wanted to choose what was important, and what was not. On Github, I also manipulated two other data sets to show the change in number of endangered species over the years and by country. I pulled this out of the same site to show this change in order to put the idea of endangered species and how effect the environment around us. By focusing in on these specific areas it dramatizes the points that I wanted to make about endangered animals. </p> 

  <p>2. An example of how you made a choice related to visualization type</p>
  <p>For the data I saw on life expectancy for men and women in synthesis one I chose to do a bar graph, initially. The graph shows the country on the x-axis and the age on the y-axis to present the difference among countries and their life expectancies. Though the bar graph looks varied I believe a better way of showing this data would have been a choropleth map. This was the first basis of my website, but I lacked the skills to create the map through python. If I were to change the visualization to a choropleth, then the data would be shown through a map with higher heat ranges around areas with more life expectancies than others. This type of format would let the user picture the data worldwide and notice the differences in regions across the world. Underdeveloped countries would have a lower life expectancy than more developed ones.
  </p>
  <p> 3. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other design elements
  </p>
  <p>My Synthesis two website focused on endangered species and explained how our impact on the environment is effecting the lives of other animals. For the home page of the site I wanted to place an image to give an example of which species are at the center of being endangered. I scaled the image so that it was right in the center and popped out at the user to show the main idea behind the website. The fonts on the page for the headings were made to be different to distinguish between the title and then a separate section for the artist statement. I chose a background that would fit well with the images and text that I was presenting along with the menu bar. If I were to change my design based on an audience that was an expert on endangered species I would present my findings through the artist statement at the top of the page, so that they would see what the web page was about. They are not looking for more information on a topic they already know, but the elements of the page. If I were gearing the page towards an audience that knew nothing about the website and its topic, then I would place more graphs and images of endangered animals to present more findings. I would make the title at the top more evident and large and make the fonts more pleasing through the use of CSS fonts. They would be more inclined to use the website if it looked pleasing at the home page, so they would go on through the site.  
  </p>
  <p> 4. An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another</p>
  <p>In Synthesis One I was not also presenting life expectancy for people, but I also was comparing the life expectancy in different countries for men and women. In this aspect I wanted to show the differences in countries, but it goes further between men and women. It is known that most of the time women outlive men and through these graphs one can see that. For Synthesis One, I placed the me and women graphs on two different sites and compared them by clicking on two separate pages. This comparison would be more effective with a revision by placing both the graphs on the same page or comparing the information in another graph. This way the user can see the difference in front of them by comparing men and women through the use of different colors to distinguish between both genders. This can be done through a bar chart with a side by a side comparison of the numbers for each country or a scatterplot with two color points for each country. By making this page it would improve the comparison I wanted to make. 
  </p>
  <p> 5.An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked </p>
  <p>In my Skills assignment this was my first attempt at creating a website with a little background in HTML and CSS. For the home page of the website my idea was to place the images side by side on the home page and I did not know how to go about this. At first, when I attempted to do this the pictures ended up placing all over the page. The pictures were not landing in the area I hoped they would, right in the center. In order to overcome the obstacle, I looked up how to attack the problem at hand and online there was a solution in order to control the margins and positioning of each picture. This helped with the formatting of the picture and then I had to control the sizes of the images appearing on the home screen. Quickly, I learned how to solve this through the width and height attributes. I learned from this experience that even though I was continuously getting frustrated and was ready to give up, there is always a solution. I knew from this point that there would be a solution for an HTML or CSS problem because many people post the solutions online. 
  </p>
  <p> 6. An example of something you are particularly proud of: </p>
    <p>The bubble chart on the Endangered Species site was particularly an aspect of my website that I was proud of. It showed the endangered species through both the years that I was comparing. This example stuck out to me because the chart pops out at the audience and seeing the difference from 2007 to 2015 is large and presented in an easy, visual way. This could be used in further visualizations that I would want to work on to show visual comparisons of certain objects or species.
