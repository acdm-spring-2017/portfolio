        <h1>Capstone Portfolio and Reflection</h1>
        <h2>A Dataset Manipulated or Queried Using Python</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/katmentecki/synthesis-2/tree/master/datasets">Populist Party and
            Hate Crime Data</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/katmentecki/synthesis-2/tree/master/.ipynb_checkpoints"
            >Synthesis 2 Python Checkpoints</a>
        <p>The dataset for Synthesis 2 was retrieved from several sources including this <a
                href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/europe/populism-in-europe-visual-guide/">CNN
                article</a>, wikipedia and European Union country websites, and the <a
                href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/infocus/find-out-more-about-odihrs-annual-reporting-hate-crimes-new-video"
                >Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a>. My manipulation of it
            collected the populist party information spread across several websites into one graph,
            so a veiwer could immediately see the rise in vote percentage. Also, by selecting the
            hate crime graph for each country, they could see if this corresponded with a similar
            rise in hate crimes. It is one thing for people to say that hate crime is rising along
            with populism, it's a bit more unsettling to see data in certain countries that agrees
            with this. It takes a feeling we get from the the violence on the news and makes it
            quantifiable, and that's what my data is trying to show. </p>
        <p>I think something lost in the changes, which remains on the CNN website, is a little more
            context regarding the elections. Since they don't occur in each country at the same
            time, and the populist party isn't always present or obvious to an uninformed observer,
            my graph could be misleading. The article on CNN does a good job of contextualizing
            their visualizations and making the right graph for each type of data.</p>
        <p>Ideally, when I started this project, I'd hoped to find two datasets: one quantifying
            public opinion of all political parties for all European countries for the last 20
            years, the other percent rise of hate crime in all European countries for the last 20
            years. This amount of data of course does not exist, and it would be a long process for
            anyone to make the bits and pieces that do exist valid and comparable to each other. I
            only got a small part of the way to that goal, and according to my critiques, still need
            to do a better job at contextualizing the information and its limitations in
            captions.</p>
        <h2>A Choice Related to Visualization Type</h2>
        <a href="https://katmentecki.github.io/mentecki-synthesis-1/synth-1_data-viz.html">Lit Paper
            Word Cloud</a>
        <p>By now I regret this choice of visualization quite a bit. It's too bright to look at and
            it doesn't really tell anyone much. It was a visualization meant to make me think about
            how my own word use, and I think it would have been more helpful to me if numbers were
            involved. I think it would make a good bar chart. Instead of trying to guess which words
            are biggest, I could actually compare them by height, or even label their frequency. For
            average users it might not be as fun and flashy as a word cloud, but if the bar chart
            was part of a larger visualization of many authors, having numbers and bar heights to
            compare instead of word sizes would be really helpful.</p>
        <h2>A Choice Related to Design</h2>
        <a href="https://katmentecki.github.io/synthesis-2/">Populist Party and Hate Crime
            Comparison</a>
        <p> I would change a lot of design elements for this visualization, and the feedback for the
            critique assignment gave me some good ideas. I would need to soften the colors and fonts
            throughout to make it all more calm. It's a heavy topic that could use a neutral or
            soothing backdrop. In this project, and most of my others, I uploaded only data viz and
            artist statement, and would need to add several things to my graphs to make them
            readable, whether the person was a beginner or an expert. This would include titles and
            labels on my graphs, short summaries of their meaning and limitations, and a page
            describing my sources. I also would work with the scales on the graphs to make the data
            larger, while making the graph itself smaller, since I think they just look ugly and
            blocky. This of course, could also have to do with matplotlib, so if I had the
            knowledge, I might have used a different plot drawing tool altogether.</p>
        <h2>A Choice Related to Comparison</h2>
        <a href="https://katmentecki.github.io/synthesis-2/">Populist Party and Hate Crime
            Comparison</a>
        <p>My most ambtious attempt to compare something was my data visualization involving the
            Populist Party and Hate Crime data. I chose it because I'd heard several people make the
            claim that hate crimes were on the rise after the recent elections in Europe and the
            United States electing populist leaders. I hadn't seen any numbers proving it and wanted
            to try and quantify it myself. The comparison was more succesful regarding election
            data, because the percentage of votes was easily comparable, even if elections weren't
            always held during the same year. But the comparison of hate crimes was ineffective for
            two reasons. One, I did not have enough knowledge of Javascript to toggle between the
            individual hate crime graphs, which would have made for less scrolling and easier direct
            comparison. Two, since the numbers of hate crimes reported were so wildly different by
            country, and weren't even better when measured per capita, I chose not to put them on
            the same graph. With a little more time to research manipulation of data, I could have
            figured out the percent rise of hate crimes for each country in each year, and then put
            them on the graph together, which would have made my comparison clearer. </p>
        <h2>An Example of Frustration</h2>
        <a href="https://katmentecki.github.io/skills/checklist/index.html">Not Understanding
            Javascript or Bootstrap</a>
        <p>It's not exactly a part of my project, but I was very frustrated in my attempts to learn
            Javascript and Bootstrap and I feel like this hindered me the whole semester. I didn't
            completely finish tutorials of either during the skills section. Though I eventually
            finished the Javascript tutorials, they didn't stick super well when I had to start
            Python immediately after. Though I struggled with it and ultimately worked around it in
            my Synthesis 2 project, working with my team members and seeing what they could do made
            it clear to me that I need to work on this skill in the very near future to better
            create websites and data visualizations. Bootstrap of course, looks so cool that I also
            need to work on my understanding of that. But I found some W3 schools pages and now that
            I'm not panicking about my skills assignment anymore, it doesn't seem that hard to
            learn.</p>
        <h2>Something I'm Particularly Proud Of</h2>
        <a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/Team1_Repo/">Team Project</a>
        <p>I really enjoyed working on the team project. We spent a very long and frustrating day in
            the library putting it together, but in the end it was very cool to see what the other
            students could do. I love how our site and our map looks, and I love that the dataset we
            created does tell a story, not just about creepy stalker apps, but also, if you
            recognize the landmarks, a story about Pittsburgh and our lives in it. It was also cool
            to be able to contribute and not feel useless among better coders by working with the
            datasets.</p>
        <h3>Something I'm Proud of Individually (So it feels less like cheating)</h3>
        <a href="https://katmentecki.github.io/synthesis-2/">Populist Party and Hate Crime
            Comparison</a>
        <p>If you haven't noticed, I like this synthesis best. If not for its execution, which was
            limited by my abilities, I like it for its potential, as well as the few elements of
            coding that I almost had, and think I could get if I had another try. I'm proud of
            making my own dataset and of creating a graph with matplotlib, even if it was directly
            off a tutorial. I would make many of the revisions I have mentioned in the other
            questions, as well as attempting to really expand my number of years and countries, if I
            chose it for future work. However, for the creativity and timeliness of the idea I say
            10/10, would make again.</p>
